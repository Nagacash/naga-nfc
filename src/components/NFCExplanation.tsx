          <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-3xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
            NFC (Near Field Communication) is a short-range wireless technology that allows two devices to communicate when they are brought within a few centimeters of each other. For NFC cards, it's incredibly simple:

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 max-w-2xl mx-auto mt-4 text-left space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Tap:</strong> A user simply taps their NFC-enabled smartphone (most modern smartphones are) against an NFC card or tag.</li>
            <li><strong>Connect:</strong> The NFC chip in the card instantly communicates with the phone.</li>
            <li><strong>Action:</strong> Without needing to open an app or type a URL, the phone is directed to perform a specific action â€“ open a website, play a song, display contact info, or prompt a Google review. It's seamless, fast, and intuitive.</li>
